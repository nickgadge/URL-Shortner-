ðŸ”— URL Shortener with Ad Redirection â€“ Project Introduction
The URL Shortener project is a smart web-based application that transforms long, cluttered URLs into short, shareable links. More than just shortening, this system introduces an innovative monetization model through ad-based redirection and AI-generated engagement pagesâ€”providing value for both educators and users.

Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Embedded JS (EJS), this application allows teachers to:
        Upload notes to a drive,
        Generate shortened links through the platform,
        Share those links with students, who view engaging, ad-supported intermediate pages before reaching the final resource.

Key Features:
        Link shortening and redirection
        Ad-based monetization for teachers
        Google Analytics integration for tracking
        AI-generated content on redirection pages to increase user engagement
        Clean UI and simple user flow for both teachers and students

This project demonstrates the effective use of full-stack development, digital marketing, and AI-enhanced user experience. Recognized at the college level, it was selected for NAAC review and also won a hackathon, highlighting its innovation and social impact in the field of education technology.
